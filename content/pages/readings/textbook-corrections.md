This page provides errata for earlier printings of the text. The printing is identified by the number sequence

10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1

on the left-hand page facing the dedication page; the above sequence identifies the first printing. Later printings delete the end of this sequence, so if the sequence ends with n, you have the nth printing.
